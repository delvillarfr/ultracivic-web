                Each token is associated with a permit that allows American businesses to emit a ton of CO2.
                When you buy a token, we remove a permit from circulation.
                Because there is one less permit available, the regulated industries must emit one less ton of CO2 into the atmosphere.
                It is that simple.

                We remove permits that are traded in well-established emissions trading systems (ETS) in the United States.
                Here, regulators have high-quality data on the emissions of the regulated industries, e.g., continuous time CO<sub>2</sub> monitors permanently installed in the smokestacks of power plants.
                This ensures that industrial emissions effectively go down by a ton if there is one less permit available.

        <h3 style="margin-top:20vh;margin-bottom:5vh;font-size:1.5em">Our take on the climate crisis.</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.4;width:75%;text-align:justify;">
            The cause of the climate crisis is the fact that polluters do not care much if their emissions harm society.
            Our view is that emissions trading systems (ETSs) address this problem head on.
            In an ETS, the government decides to cap the aggregate emissions (in tons of CO<sub>2</sub>) of a set of regulated firms and issues the corresponding amount of permits.
            It then requires the regulated firms to own permits for the right to emit a ton of CO<sub>2</sub>.
            Firms can trade these permits, according to their needs and costs of reducing emissions.
            Naturally, those who find it hard to reduce emissions buy permits from those who find it easy.
            At the end of the day, the regulated firms meet the cap on aggregate emissions, with most of the reduction coming from firms who find it easy to curb their emissions.
            In an ideal configuration, the supply of carbon allowances induces an equilibrium allowance price equal to the social cost of carbon --- the cost to society of releasing an additional ton of CO2 into the atmosphere.
            Here, polluters effectively consider the social harm of their emissions when they make production decisions.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.4;width:75%;text-align:justify">
            Unfortunately, the supply of allowances in existing ETSs is too generous.
            Current market prices of allowances are around 25 dollars, or one half of the U.S. government's estimate of the social cost of carbon, which is lower than most scientific estimates.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.4;width:75%;text-align:justify">
            Our mission is to improve existing emissions trading systems by letting anyone in the world participate.
            We enable people from across the world to pay for regulated industries in existing ETSs to reduce their emissions.
