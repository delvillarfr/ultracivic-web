          Electricity is great, so is it good to lower power plants' emissions?
        </p>
      </button>
      <div class="answer atkinson text-specs">
        <p>
          Electricity is good; carbon emissions are bad.
          When you lower power plants' emissions, you lower both, so you might wonder if you did something good or bad.
          You did something good.
          Here is why.        
        </p>
        <p>
          The damage to us, humanity, of another ton of carbon in the air is one of the costs of generating power from fossil fuels.
          Power plants do not pay this cost.
          We do.
          Coal is cheap for them and expensive for us.
          If they paid the cost of every ton of carbon they emit, the dissonance would go away, and they would use less coal to generate electricity than they currently do.
          In other words, some of the electricity they generate does more harm than good, and they would generate only good electricity if they paid the cost of their emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          States in the Northeast have set out to make them pay by requiring them to buy an allowance for every ton of carbon they emit.
          Now, in 2025, every short ton of carbon they emit costs us
          <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-12/epa_scghg_2023_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" class="link-style">
            between 118 and 327 USD
          </a>.
          The cost they actually pay, however, is the allowance price, which is somewhere between 20-26 USD.
          This means that there are too many allowances and they are polluting too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          How much?
          The difference between what they emit and what they would emit if they paid 118-327 USD for an allowance.
          Until allowance prices hit that range, every ton of carbon you make them cut is a ton of carbon they would not emit if they cared about us.

          What is the difference between Ultra Civic and carbon credits?
        </p>
      </button>
      <div class="answer atkinson text-specs">
        <p>
          When you buy a carbon credit, you pay someone who claims to have lowered the amount of carbon in the air by one ton some time back.
          When you buy a pollution allowance and lock it up, you make power plants cut future emissions by one ton.
          With a carbon credit, you hope to encourage future climate action by rewarding past climate action.
          With power plant allowances, you make future climate action happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another difference is that you know the climate impact of buying an allowance and locking it up, but you do not know the impact of most climate actions behind carbon credits.
          The trees you planted yesterday could burn tomorrow.
          The solar park you contributed to might have been

            built without your help.
          </a>
          Add this measurement problem to the fact that carbon credit businesses boom if their climate impact is big, and you get exaggerated claims.
          In contrast, 
          <a href="index.html#proof" target="_blank" class="link-style" style="display: inline;">
            power plants' emissions are measured well.

          What is the difference between Ultra Civic and renewable energy certificates?
        </p>
      </button>
      <div class="answer atkinson text-specs">
        <p>
          When you buy a renewable energy certificate (REC), you pay someone who generated one megawatt-hour of electricity from renewable sources some time back.
          With carbon credits, you hoped to encourage future climate action (1 ton CO<sub>2</sub>) by rewarding past climate action (1 ton CO<sub>2</sub>).
          With RECs, you hope to encourage future renewable power generation (1 MWh) by rewarding past renewable power generation (1 MWh).
        </p>
        <p>
          RECs are a carrot for renewable generation; Ultra Civic is a stick.
          RECs pay for past renewable generation.
          When you buy a permit and lock it up, you make permits scarcer, and drive up the cost of dirty generation.
          Both incentives push power plants to move away from fossil fuels.
          The cool thing about buying a permit and locking it away is that you also clean the air by a ton of carbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also... You do not cancel what power plants emitted to power you by purchasing RECs.

          What if Trump kills the pollution allowance system?
        </p>
      </button>
      <div class="answer atkinson text-specs">
        <p>
          What if Trump, or WITTY, questions are fun.
          Yesterday, you bought an allowance and locked it up.
          Today, our wobbly politicians decide that power plants are free to pollute, starting next year.
          This is a stretch, since the allowance system is run by ten states, not the federal government.
          Anything is possible in 2025, though, so let us press on. 
          Would yesterday's climate action still have impact?
        </p>
        <p>
          If power plants will use every available allowance before next year, yes.
          If you had not bought and locked it up, they would have used your allowance to emit another ton of carbon.
          Yesterday's climate action makes them cut a ton of carbon by the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, instead, power plants have more permits than they need to get to next year, the answer is no.
          They emit the same amount of carbon, regardless of whether you bought an allowance and locked it up, or not :(
        </p>
        <p>
          If power plants are free to pollute, starting
          <span class="atkinson-italic">tomorrow,</span>
          then yesterday's climate action will surely have no impact.
          But what if the deadline is in two years? Or three?
          How long does it take power plants to go through all allowances in circulation?
